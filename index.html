        <h1>Poem for Gabča...</h1>
        <p>I'm not a poetist, but as a man I can say,</p>
        <p>you are too beautiful to let you go by.</p>
        <p>I can't hold it no more, I have to say,</p>
        <p>I fell in love again when you texted me that day.</p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>I heard that you got heartbroken,</p>
        <p>let me fix it for you.</p>
        <p>You can take my heart,</p>
        <p>It's waiting for you.</p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>I didn't know how to tell you anyway,</p>
        <p>so I made a poem to tell you,</p>
        <p>come fuck me the hard way.</p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>I want to ask you out as time slips by,</p>
        <p>But I don't know how should I.</p>
        <p>I needed to tell you so desperately,</p>
        <p>so I could ease my mind.</p>
        <p>   </p>
        <p>I love you so much,</p>
        <p>you don't even realize.</p>
        <p>I sent you pickup lines,</p>
        <p>to let you realize.</p>
