        <h1>Poem for Gabča...</h1>
        <p>I'm not an poetist but as man I can can say,
you are too beautifull to let you go by.
I can't hold it no more, I have to say,
I fell in love again when you texted me that day.

I heard that you got heartbroken,
let me fix it for you.
You can take my heart,
It's waiting for you.

I didn't know how to tell you anyway,
so I made poem to tell you,
come fuck me the hard way.

I want to ask you out as time slips by,
But I don't know how should I.
I needed to tell you so desperate,
so I could ease my mind.

I love you so much,
you don't even realize.
I sent you pckup lines,
to let you realize.</p>
